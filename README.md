library project
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here the Library web application is frontend app in which the librarian can add/modify books and do some basic librarian options. The frontend app will just take care of displaying values and sending the values to be updated to microservice app(libraryservice). The responsibilty of fetching the list of books from the db or talking to the db is taken care by microservice app. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I developed another android app to talk to microservices app to just list set of books. This way we can affirm that adnroid app can also use  rest services provided by libraryservices app i.e microservices app is working. </p>

<p>The Naming server app plays the main role in making microservices to communicate to library web app. I could not implement API gateway app. But that will be in next release.</p>
